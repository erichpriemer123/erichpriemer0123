    <p>This website is the representation of my coding journey. It will showcase the progress I make when it comes to writing HTML,CSS, and Javascript.
    Even though I am new to coding, I am hoping to make lots of progress thoughout the next four years.  I believe that, as a young man in this very large and scary world,
    that I am capable of anything I put my mind too. Through persistance and goal setting I will be successful.</p>

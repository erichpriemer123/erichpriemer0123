        Hello, I am Erich Priemer. I am 18 years old and I'm currently attending the University of Rhode Island.
        I grew up in Bloomfield, CT and attended The Metropolitan Learning Center for middle school and highschool.
        The Metropolitan Learning Center was an International Baccalaureate school and was very challenging. 
        Though it was a challenge I believe that they properly prepared me for the workload I would receive in college.
        In Highschool I ran track and played soccer for sports. Even though I am not playing on a sports team currently in college,
        I still love to run and exercise in my free time.  
      </p>
